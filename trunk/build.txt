======================
Building ActivityGraph
======================

ActivityGraph can be built and run using the included ant script (build.xml).
You'll need Ant version 1.7.0 or higher to run the (JUnit 4.x) unit tests, but earlier 
versions of ants should be able to successfully compile and run ActivityGraph. 

To build ActivityGraph, type::

 ant compile
 
To run the unit tests, type::

 ant test
 
To run ActivityGraph, type::

 ant run

To generate an ActivityGraph zipfile, run the bin/generate_release.sh script. Note that the script assumes that the directories ~/work and ~/testinstall already exist.
