== !ShellLogger isn't setting my prompt properly ==

Sometimes your prompt may be modified by some other Unix shell script. For example, if bash is your shell, check for modifications to the PS1 variable in:

 * .profile
 * .bash_profile
 * .bash_login
 * .login
 * .bashrc

Sometimes there are system-wide versions of these files (often in
/etc/skel) that are in effect.
