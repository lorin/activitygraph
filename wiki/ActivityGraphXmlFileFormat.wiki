An !ActivityGraph XML file looks something like this:

{{{
<ActivityGraph>

A ''Series'' of data elements is made up of either ''Points'' (that occur in a single instant in time) or ''Intervals'' (that have a start and end time). ''Series'' are organized into ''!SeriesGroups''. An optional "text" and "note" attribute can be added to any ''Point'' or ''Interval'' element, which will appear as a tooltip. "text" is intended for objective information about the element, and "note" is intended for more subjective annotations.

Times are specified as seconds since the epoch (Jan. 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC), also known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time Unix time]. (Note that the Java standard library uses milliseconds since the start of the Unix epoch instead of seconds).
