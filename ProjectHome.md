The purpose of ActivityGraph is to provide support for developing and evaluating workflow heuristics to determine where programmers spend their time.

It should allow you to visualize the developer activities at different levels of abstraction, from low-level captured events, to higher-level events that have either been inferred from lower-level ones or observed in some other way. It's general enough that it could be used to analyze any type of temporal, categorical data.

Ultimately, it should allow you to compare the output of heuristics with some "true" output, to identify how accurate the heuristics are, as well as identifying where errors are occurring.
