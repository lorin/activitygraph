Building ActivityGraph
======================

ActivityGraph can be built and run using the included ant script (build.xml).
You'll need Ant version 1.7.0 or higher to run the (JUnit 4.x) unit tests, but earlier 
versions of ants should be able to successfully compile and run ActivityGraph. 

To build ActivityGraph, type::

 $ ant compile
 
To run the unit tests, type::

 $ ant test
 
To run ActivityGraph, type::

 $ ant run

Packaging ActivityGraph
=======================

If you wish to create a package of ActivityGraph for deployment, first make sure you have a ~/work directory (where a pristine version of ActivityGraph will be checked out) and a ~/testinstall directory (which will contain the deployed files).

Also make sure your local subversion sandbox is up to date before generating a package.

To generate a package, type::

 $ cd bin
 $ sh generate_release.sh

This will do the following:

 * Check out the latest version of ActivityGraph to ~/work/ActivityGraph
 * Run the unit tests on the newly checked out version
 * Create a zipfile in ~/work/ActivityGraph/dist
 * Unzip this file into ~/testinstall/ActivityGraph-rxx where xx is the revision number returned by the svnversion command
